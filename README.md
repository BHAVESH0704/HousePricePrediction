📘 My Machine Learning Journey – House Price Prediction

I started as a complete beginner with basic Python knowledge and no real ML project experience.

🚀 Phase 1: Absolute Basics

Understood what Machine Learning is (learning from data, not rules)

Learned the idea of input (X) and output (y)

Built my first Linear Regression model

Predicted house prices using Area

Learned how to:

Load CSV data

Train a model

Make predictions

Plot results

📊 Phase 2: Real ML Workflow

Learned why Train–Test split is important

Implemented:

train_test_split

Model evaluation using MSE

Understood that:

Low error = better model

Models must be tested on unseen data

🌍 Phase 3: Real-World Data (Kaggle)

Learned how to:

Create a Kaggle account

Download a real dataset

Import train.csv

Worked with real, messy data

Selected meaningful features:

GrLivArea

BedroomAbvGr

FullBath

OverallQual

Learned data cleaning using dropna()

📉 Phase 4: Improving the Model

Understood why MSE was high

Learned feature importance

Used StandardScaler correctly

Learned:

When scaling is needed

When scaling should NOT be used

Fixed common beginner mistakes:

Feature mismatch

Inconsistent preprocessing

🌳 Phase 5: Random Forest (Big Upgrade)

Switched from Linear Regression → Random Forest

Learned:

Random Forest handles non-linear data better

Scaling is NOT required

Achieved much better predictions

Evaluated model using:

MSE

R² score

Understood what negative R² means and how to fix it

Learned debugging ML pipelines (very important skill)

🧠 Phase 6: Debugging & Understanding Errors

Fixed:

Feature-name warnings

Train/Test mismatch issues

Evaluation inconsistencies

Learned that:

ML problems often come from pipeline mistakes, not algorithms

Built confidence in reading and understanding errors

🧰 Phase 7: Git & GitHub (Professional Step)

Learned Git from scratch:

git init

git add

git commit

git remote

git pull

git push

Solved real Git issues:

Upstream branch error

Remote already contains work

Merging unrelated histories

Successfully pushed my ML project to GitHub

🏆 What I Achieved

Built a real ML project

Used industry-level dataset

Applied proper ML workflow

Learned model evaluation

Debugged real errors

Published project on GitHub

Reached intermediate ML level

🎯 Where I Am Now

I am no longer a beginner who just copies code.
I can:

Build ML models

Improve them

Debug them

Explain them

Share them professionally
